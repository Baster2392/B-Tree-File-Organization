# B-Tree File Organization  

## Project Description  
This project is a Python implementation of a **B-Tree**, a self-balancing tree structure optimized for systems handling large datasets. It supports operations such as insertion, deletion, and search, with the ability to manage tree nodes on disk for scalability. The project includes an interactive interface for user commands, allowing direct manipulation and visualization of the tree.

## Features  
1. **Efficient Operations**: Includes insertion, deletion, and search with self-balancing to maintain optimal performance.  
2. **Disk Storage**: Nodes are saved as files, enabling processing of datasets too large to fit in memory.  
3. **Interactive Command-Line Interface**: Users can perform operations and visualize the tree structure dynamically.
